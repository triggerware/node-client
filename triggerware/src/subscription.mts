/**
* A `Subscription` represents some future change to the data managed by the TW server about which
* a client would like to be notified. Once created, this subscription will accept notifications from
* the server when a change occurs, then call the overridden method handleNotification.
*
* By default, subscriptions are **active** when they are createdâ€”they are immediately registered
* with the server and start receiving notifications. This behavior may be changed upon construction,
* or by calling either the activate or deactivate methods. 
*
* Subscriptions may either be created by passing in a TriggerwareClient, in which case they
* are immediately registered with the server, OR by passing in a BatchSubscription. See
* BatchSubscription documentation for more information.
*
* @typeparam T - The expected type of one data tuple.
